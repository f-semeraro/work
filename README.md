# Vulnerability Viewer

Simple client-side tool to inspect vulnerability reports generated by Grype.
Load a JSON SBOM in SPDX format and use the provided filters to narrow down
results. The table is rendered with [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) to
offer pagination and sorting.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Select the Grype JSON file via the file picker.
3. Adjust filters (severity, fix status, EPSS, percentile, risk score or CVE ID)
   to refine the entries.
4. Enable **Group by CVE** to collapse multiple matches under the same
   vulnerability ID. Click a group header to expand or collapse it.

The **Results per page** selector controls the number of rows displayed per
page inside the DataTable.
